# Subtract-a-square
This is a simple text-based implementation of a two-player mathematical game of strategy.
It involves a number, and the two players subtract square numbers from it turn by turn.
Whoever gets to zero first wins, according to normal play, and loses according to mis√®re play.

## Usage
It is written in Python, so to run it you will have to install the Python interpreter 
from their website. After that, just run `python subtract-a-square.py` and play the game.

## Configuration
Configuration is available by editing the source file. Just change the line where it says 
`NORMALPLAY = True` and replace True with False (with the capital 'F'). To change the game 
from the easier, less intelligent mode to the smarter, more hardworking mode, change the 
line where it says `NEWPLAYER = True` and replace True with False (with the capital 'F').
